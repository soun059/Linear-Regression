# Linear-Regression
Containing all the possible algorithms for linear regression not just gradient descent but some more with all round math implementation without any module use like tensorflow or scikit-learn.
It contain all the possible codes for the algorithmic implementaion of Linear Regression with examples and real life examples as well as other features not discussed widely
